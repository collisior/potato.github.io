Fibonacci page:
This code uses the canvas element to draw circles representing the Fibonacci sequence. The drawFibonacciSpiral function is called recursively using requestAnimationFrame to create the animation effect. The Fibonacci numbers determine the radius of each circle, and their positions create the spiral pattern. The canvas is cleared and redrawn in each frame to create the illusion of movement.
