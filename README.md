## Fibonacci page:
A dynamic webpage with a moving Fibonacci spiral involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a simple example to get you started. This example uses the HTML5 canvas element to draw the Fibonacci spiral and updates its position to create the illusion of movement. 
>This code uses the canvas element to draw circles representing the Fibonacci sequence. The drawFibonacciSpiral function is called recursively using requestAnimationFrame to create the animation effect. The Fibonacci numbers determine the radius of each circle, and their positions create the spiral pattern. The canvas is cleared and redrawn in each frame to create the illusion of movement.
